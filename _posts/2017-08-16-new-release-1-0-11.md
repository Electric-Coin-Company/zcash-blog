Today we're announcing the release of Zcash 1.0.11, which includes bug fixes and usability improvements.

Summary of the changes included in this release:
<ol class="arabic simple">
 	<li>We fixed a <tt class="docutils literal">401 Unauthorized</tt> bug encountered when using some JSON-RPC libraries. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2529">#2529</a>)</li>
 	<li>We changed <tt class="docutils literal">z_sendmany</tt> to fail with an error if the user sets <tt class="docutils literal">minconf=0</tt> when sending from z-addresses. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2525">#2525</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2526">#2526</a>)</li>
 	<li>We extended the <tt class="docutils literal">listunspent</tt> RPC method to specify whether outputs were from a coinbase transaction, to help users identify t-addresses that need to have their contents shielded. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2522">#2522</a>)</li>
 	<li>We added a block download progress indicator to the metrics UI. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2484">#2484</a>)</li>
 	<li>We removed UPnP support (which was already off by default) for security reasons. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2504">#2504</a>)</li>
</ol>
