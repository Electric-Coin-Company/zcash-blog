Hello, I'm Nathan Wilcox and I do project management and engineering on Zcash. I'm delighted to announce the most recent hire onto <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash/team.html#engineers">our engineering team</a>: Jack Grigg.

When Zooko first excitedly exclaimed he had been in contact with Jack about working with us, I'll admit the name wasn't familiar to me. It turns out, that's because I was only familiar with his superhero alter-ego: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/str4d">str4d</a>.
<div class="figure align-center"><img class="zecc-blog-standard-image" src="http://blog.z.cash/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jack.jpg" alt="Jack Grigg aka str4d"" alt="Jack Grigg aka str4d" />

By day, Jack is an applied physics PhD student, and by night, a privacy-focused crypto hacker. At Real World Crypto '16, str4d made the bold step of unmasking this pseudonym.

I first became aware of str4d as a contributor on the integration of privacy-preserving network protocols such as <a class="reference external" href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a> into <a class="reference external" href="http://foolscap.lothar.com/trac">foolscap</a>, a capabilities-secure remote procedure call <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> library and protocol. Under this pseudonym, Jack actively contributes to or leads development on <a class="reference external" href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/i2p/i2p.android.base">I2P Android</a>, and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/str4d/txi2p">txi2p</a> endpoint for <a class="reference external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>, as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/str4d/ed25519-java">ed25519-java</a>.

All of this has been in addition to his by-day work as a physics student where he's working on a thesis about sheep's wool. A true polyglot, Jack's been settling in quite naturally on our team. His first task is to create a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/str4d/zcash-pow">mining prototype</a> for Zcash <a id="id1" class="footnote-reference" href="#id2">[*]</a>. Please join us in welcoming Jack Grigg aka str4d out of the crypto-closet and into wondrous land of cryptocurrency.

<td>We've seen a lot of curiosity about Zcash mining. While we haven't settled on specifics, this is certainly the codebase to watch in the coming month to see what we're prototyping.</td>
