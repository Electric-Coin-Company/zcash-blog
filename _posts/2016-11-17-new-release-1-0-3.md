<p>Today we're announcing the release of Zcash 1.0.3 which fixes several crashes and security bugs, improves performance, and adjusts relay policies.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend users and miners update to this version, as it fixes a cache invalidation bug that could be used by an attacker to disrupt the network. (See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1874">#1874</a>.)</p>
<p>Other changes in this release include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple"><li>We fixed a bug that caused the wallet to crash during startup in some situations, such as when the wallet is not synchronized properly with the blockchain. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1858">#1858</a>)</li>
<li>We re-enabled note randomization that was temporarily disabled in 1.0.2. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1814">#1814</a>)</li>
<li>We adjusted fee policies to reflect changes made in Bitcoin Core and encourage relaying of transactions containing JoinSplits. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1855">#1855</a>)</li>
<li>We improved diagnostics and strengthened testing for the merkle tree's interaction with the constraint system. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1797">#1797</a>)</li>
<li>We disabled RPC keepalive features temporarily to avoid deadlocks. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1847">#1847</a>)</li>
<li>We adjusted our use of the libsnark verification API to improve zk-SNARK verification performance by 10%.

<li>We changed the error message format for <cite>z_sendmany</cite> so that amounts are displayed in units of ZEC. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1838">#1838</a>)</li>
