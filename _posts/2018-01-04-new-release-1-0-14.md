<p>Today we're announcing the release of Zcash 1.0.14, which contains new features, bug fixes, and documentation improvements.</p>

<h2>Notable changes</h2>

<h3>Incoming viewing keys</h3>
<p>Support for incoming viewing keys, as described in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf">the Zcash protocol spec</a>, has been added to the wallet.</p>
<p>Use the <tt class="docutils literal">z_exportviewingkey</tt> RPC method to obtain the incoming viewing key for a z-address in a node's wallet. For Sprout z-addresses, these always begin with "ZiVK" (or "ZiVt" for testnet z-addresses). Use <tt class="docutils literal">z_importviewingkey</tt> to import these into another node.</p>
<p>A node that possesses an incoming viewing key for a z-address can view all past
transactions received by that address, as well as all future transactions sent
to it, by using <tt class="docutils literal">z_listreceivedbyaddress</tt>. They cannot spend any funds from the
address. This is similar to the behaviour of "watch-only" t-addresses.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">z_gettotalbalance</tt> now has an additional boolean parameter for including the
balance of "watch-only" addresses (both transparent and shielded), which is set
to <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt> by default. <tt class="docutils literal">z_getbalance</tt> has also been updated to work with
watch-only addresses.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Caution:</strong> for z-addresses, these balances will <strong>not</strong> be accurate if any
funds have been sent from the address. This is because incoming viewing keys
cannot detect spends, and so the "balance" is just the sum of all received
notes, including ones that have been spent. Some future use-cases for incoming
viewing keys will include synchronization data to keep their balances accurate
(e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2542">#2542</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sprout circuit value tracking</h3>
<p>Nodes can now track the total amount of shielded ZEC inside the Sprout circuit.
This is measured by adding up the ZEC moving between the Transparent Value Pool
and JoinSplits (see <a class="reference external" href="/anatomy-of-zcash/">Anatomy of a Zcash Transaction</a>).
<tt class="docutils literal">getblockchaininfo</tt> shows the total for the entire chain, while <tt class="docutils literal">getblock</tt>
will show the total as of a specific block.</p>
<p>To enable this monitoring on a specific node, it must be re-indexed. This will
take several hours to complete, but otherwise will not affect any other node
data.</p>
