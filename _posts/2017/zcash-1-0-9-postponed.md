<p>We have decided to postpone the Zcash Sprout 1.0.9 release from today's planned release date to mid-May.</p>
<p>We have been planning a transition in May of our release process and policies to improve our collaborations with community and industry partners, to improve safety, and to prepare for our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/the-near-future-of-zcash/">Sapling protocol upgrade</a>. Due to the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/new-release-1-0-8-1/">v1.0.8-1 hotfix release</a> last week, it makes the most sense to postpone 1.0.9 until the new process is in place.</p>
<p>We'll post an announcement of the new release process and policies ahead of the 1.0.9 release. We have exciting features and collaborations underway. Stay tuned!</p>
