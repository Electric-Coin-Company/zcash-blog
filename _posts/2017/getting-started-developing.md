<p>Over the short history of Zcash, we've seen a substantial growth in the ecosystem from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zcashcommunity.com/wallets/">wallets</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zcashcommunity.com/markets/">exchanges</a> to more experimental applications like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/whyrusleeping/zmsg">zmsg</a>. As the Zcash core development team continues to improve the underlying Zcash protocol, we encourage more developers to join the community!</p>
<p>You can easily integrate Zcash into your existing cryptocurrency app, or you can use Zcash to build something new. There's plenty of opportunity to become part of the roots growing the Zcash ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Level 1 Support (Transparent addresses)</h2>
<p>Supporting transparent addresses in Zcash is a very similar process to supporting bitcoin. Implementing these addresses is the simplest way to get started and this is by far the most popular way we've seen third-parties make use of Zcash in their applications, at least for now.</p>
<p>While transparent addresses don't allow users to send privately, in many cases the mere existence and use of shielded addresses by others provides <a class="reference external" href="/blog/transaction-linkability/">protection from linkability</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-2-support-shielded-addresses">
<h2>Level 2 Support (Shielded addresses)</h2>
<p>Supporting shielded addresses requires more work but we encourage those interested to take advantage of their added capabilities. <a class="reference external" href="https://shapeshift.io">ShapeShift</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-and-zcash">Keybase</a> are two examples of services which work with shielded addresses.</p>
<p>We're doing a lot of work to make shielded addresses easier to support and more useful. For example, some <a class="reference external" href="https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/blog/the-near-future-of-zcash/">near future priorities</a> for Zcash development include <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2159">payment disclosure</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2120">payment offloading</a> which open up a lot of opportunities for third-parties. If you're interested in being one of the first to implement these when they're released as experimental features, get in touch (see below)!</p>
