<p>The Zcash company grew out of a company named “Least Authority”. It was when we were Least Authority that we did a <a class="reference external" href="http://leastauthority.com/blog/least_authority_performs_incentive_analysis_for_ethereum/">security audit of Ethereum</a> and several other successful security audits (<a class="reference external" href="http://leastauthority.com/blog/least_authority_performs_security_audit_for_cryptocat/">CryptoCat</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://leastauthority.com/blog/least_authority_performs_security_audit_for_globaleaks/">GlobalLeaks</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://leastauthority.com/blog/least_authority_performs_security_audit_for_spideroak/">SpiderOak</a>, and Ooni). Least Authority also developed the advanced cryptographically-protected, decentralized file store, <a class="reference external" href="https://tahoe-lafs.org">Tahoe-LAFS</a>.</p>
<p>When we formed a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/helloworld/">new company to launch Zcash</a> (the “Zerocoin Electric Coin Company”, a.k.a. “The Zcash Company”), we split off from Least Authority and at first I tried to continue acting as the CEO of both companies at once. Perhaps I was influenced by the legends of Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey, two people who currently serve as CEOs of two different companies.</p>
<p>But you know what? No way was that going to work. The run-up to the Zcash launch consumed all of my time and attention, and the Least Authoritarians continued to develop their cutting-edge open source technology, but they had to do so without any business support from me.</p>
<p>Therefore I'm delighted to announce that our sibling company, Least Authority, now has a new full-time CEO: Liz Steininger. I've worked with Liz before on Internet freedom technology; I trust her ethics and her judgment. Her excellent skills at organization, planning, and business are a good match for the excellent cryptography and coding skills of the other Least Authoritarians.</p>
<p>Least Authority has incorporated in Berlin, Germany (the world capitol for Internet freedom hackers) and launched <a class="reference external" href="https://LeastAuthority.com">a new web site</a>. The team continues to do specialized security audits and create freedom-compatible technologies, and has some big things in the works that you'll hear more about soon, including a user-friendly way to use their secure storage product.</p>
<p>Right now you can <a class="reference external" href="https://s4.leastauthority.com/s4-subscription-form">sign up</a> for Least Authority's “S4” service, which is a cloud storage service built on top of Amazon S3, with the addition of our advanced open source end-to-end encryption so that your data is never exposed to snooping or injection.</p>
<p>(P.S. For fans of cryptocurrency history, here's that time I posted about Tahoe-LAFS on BitcoinTalk.org back in 2010 and <a class="reference external" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=890.0">Satoshi Nakamoto replied</a>.)</p>
