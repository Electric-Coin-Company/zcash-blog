<p>An exciting update for the Zcash ecosystem comes from the <a class="reference external" href="https://jaxx.io/">Jaxx</a> team. Jaxx were one of the very first wallets to support Zcash, implementing it into their Android and desktop wallets only days after the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/zcash-begins">Zcash launch</a> on October 28th.</p>
<p>In their initial statement announcing integration with Zcash, they indicated upcoming support in their iOS wallet and today, Zcash on <a class="reference external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jaxx-blockchain-wallet/id1084514516">Jaxx for iOS</a> is live!</p>
<p>Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Jaxx, says, "The privacy aspect of their technology meshes really well with Jaxx’s philosophies. We’ve been working on a Zcash integrated iOS version for a long time and we’re over the moon that Zcash has been approved on the App Store."</p>
<p>Jaxx for iOS has 32,000 users and growing. With the inclusion of Zcash, now hundreds of millions of users have the ability to send and receive Zcash from their iPhones.</p>
<p>Jaxx has additionally confirmed their interest in supporting <a class="reference external" href="/blog/anatomy-of-zcash">shielded addresses</a> in the future. As more wallets with easy-to-use interfaces introduce shielded addresses into their software, not only will the users of those applications gain enhanced privacy for transactions they send and receive but also, the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/shielded-ecosystem">ecosystem as a whole will become more private</a>.</p>
<p>We are excited about the expansion of Zcash into additional operating systems and hope to see this trigger more support for Zcash in iOS moving forward.</p>
<p>Jaxx for iOS joins a <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashblog.wordpress.com/zcash-gui-wallets/">growing list</a> of third-party GUI applications supporting Zcash. Wallets considering adding Zcash support should reach out to us in <a class="reference external" href="mailto:info@z.cash">email</a> or by joining our <a class="reference external" href="https://chat.zcashcommunity.com">community chat</a>, we'd be happy to help!</p>
