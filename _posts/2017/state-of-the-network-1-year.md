<p>One year ago, we published our very first <a class="reference external" href="/blog/state-of-the-network-2016-10-31/">State of the Network</a> announcing the successful launch of Zcash 1.0 “Sprout”. Much of the Zcash team were gathered in the livingroom of an Airbnb in Pacifica, California to see the project we had dedicated many months of effort to build finally reach genesis. And many of you <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8QA6Nvg8RI">watched</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, the Zcash ecosystem has experienced radical growth, the Zcash network has been pushed to limits and the Zcash zk-SNARK technology has gained substantial notoriety in the greater cryptocurrency and privacy communities. In one year, we've seen adoption of Zcash into <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashcommunity.com/wallets">wallets</a> developed by both individuals in the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/community-projects/">community</a> and established companies. We've seen adoption into <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashcommunity.com/markets">markets</a> all around the world.</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p>Since the launch of Zcash, we've released 12 <a class="reference external" href="/blog/tag/releases/">software updates</a> for the official Zcash client and have additionally maintained a regular schedule of weekly <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.z.cash/c/dev-updates">developer updates</a>.</p>
<p>We've improved internal procedures including the official client <a class="reference external" href="/blog/release-cycle-update/">release cycle</a> and a <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash/support/security/announcements.html">security procedure</a> for investigating potential vulnerabilities to users. We're proud to be able to state that no bugs in the code have caused loss of funds or loss of privacy.</p>

<p>During this year, the Zcash Foundation <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/hello-world/">established itself</a> as an entity distinct from the Zcash Company with it's own executive board and regular weekly office hours. Some of their first projects include distributing <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/test-transactions/">pioneer awards</a> to key contributors in the Zcash community, <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/courage-foundation-welcomes-zcash-donations/">helping organizations</a> accept Zcash donations and establishing <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/grant-program/">a Grant program</a> to fund ideas and projects improving the Zcash ecosystem. More recently, the Foundation was <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/zcash-foundation-officially-nonprofit/">granted 501(c)3</a> status.</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p>Research and development for Zcash 2.0 "Sapling" is <a class="reference external" href="/blog/tag/sapling/">well underway</a>. We are planning the roadmap documenting what the steps will be to get there with a goal to have it ready by the end of 2018. Sapling will bring with it substantial improvements to the security and efficiency of the cryptography used by Zcash shielded addresses.</p>
<p>While we wait for Sapling, however, other <a class="reference external" href="/blog/the-near-future-of-zcash/">previously mentioned</a> features will be introduced into Sprout which improve usability of shielded addresses.</p>
<p>The future year has a lot more in store for Zcash and we look forward to sharing those achievements in the 2 year anniversary State of the Network.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Zcash Community! &lt;3</p>
