Today we're announcing the release of Zcash 1.0.12, which includes bug fixes and usability improvements. It also adds a new RPC method <tt class="docutils literal">z_shieldcoinbase</tt> as an experimental feature, for easily shielding coinbase UTXOs. We encourage mining pools and exchanges to test it out over the next few weeks, and give feedback, before we make it a fully-supported RPC method in an upcoming release.

Summary of the changes included in this release:

<strong>REMINDER</strong>: The 1.0.9 release will reach deprecation in the next day or so, and 1.0.9 nodes will automatically shut down at that time. See our <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash/blog/release-cycle-update.html">blog post last week</a> for details. Users running 1.0.9 should take one of the following steps:
<ul class="simple">
 	<li>Upgrade to the <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash/download.html">latest release</a> of <tt class="docutils literal">zcashd</tt>.</li>
 	<li>Opt-out of deprecation by using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-disabledeprecation=1.0.9</span></tt> config flag.</li>
</ul>
