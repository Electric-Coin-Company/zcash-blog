<p><em>This article is the first in a three-part series about Zcash marketing. Stay tuned for a future post about how we see the market evolving and another which will outline our 2019 marketing approach.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In June of this year, the Zcash Company leadership met to set strategic priorities. We <a href="https://z.cash/blog/zcash-company-proposed-roadmap/">communicated a proposed roadmap</a> and subsequently distilled <a href="https://z.cash/blog/zcash-strategy-update-november-2018/">our strategic priorities</a> into three areas: </p>

<ol><li>Drive adoption while maintaining quality</li><li>Invest in our team</li><li>Increase openness and collaboration</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In spite of a challenging 2018 for the cryptocurrency market, the Zcash Company remained focused, and the team successfully delivered its first two network upgrades, <a href="https://z.cash/blog/overwinter-activated-successfully/">Overwinter</a> and <a href="https://z.cash/blog/sapling-activation-complete/">Sapling</a>. These releases included significant cryptographic breakthroughs that are laying the foundation for broad adoption of Zcash. In parallel, the Zcash Company formalized a go-to-market (GTM) team to thoughtfully and intentionally drive awareness and adoption. These were some of the highlights.</p>

<h2>Drive adoption while maintaining quality</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Zcash Company formalized a global GTM approach for 2019 (watch for that post in early January). We clarified our mission to “<em>Empower everyone with economic freedom and opportunity.</em>” In support of our mission, we launched <a href="https://z.cash/blog/everyone/">a new brand, website</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Zcash Company formalized a global GTM strategy and approach for 2019 (watch for that post in the coming weeks). We clarified our mission to “Empower everyone with economic freedom and opportunity.” In support of our mission, we launched a new brand, website and video to make the story more accessible to more people. The result has been good, as we’ve seen an increase in page views per session and longer visits, as well as a lower bounce rate. The homepage garnered more than a million views, blog posts saw almost 400 thousand hits and the download page was visited just under 250 thousand times.

<p>Driving adoption was a key theme for the year, and we spent considerable time and effort pursuing exchange and wallet adoption through Zcash Company-delivered education, regulatory support and engineering. This led to 25 additional listings in 13 countries, including two of the most respected and heavily-regulated exchanges in the world:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://z.cash/blog/gemini-announces-support-for-zcash/" target="_blank">Gemini</a> (with approval from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Driving adoption was a key theme for the year, and we spent considerable time and effort pursuing exchange and wallet adoption through Zcash Company-delivered education, regulatory support and engineering.

It has been a common misconception that regulated exchanges cannot support Zcash, which proved to be false. It is now a common misconception that regulated exchanges cannot support shielded addresses, which will also prove to be false in the coming year.

All of this adoption was organic (it is our policy to not pay any listing fees) and possible because of our strong reputation for delivery, a common belief in our mission, and relationships built over time. We also saw the number of wallets supporting Zcash increase including Exodus and Guarda. Also, a number of over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks added Zcash including Cumberland, Galaxy and Circle. We’ve been told that Zcash is now a Top 5 coin in trade volume on these desks.

<h2>Invest in the team</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GTM team was formalized this year and is focused on marketing (awareness, education, user adoption, public relations and market strategy) and business development (third-party adoption and enablement). I’d like to introduce the team.<br /></p>

<p>Securing <a href="https://z.cash/trademark-policy/">trademarks</a> for Zcash was another area of focus. The trademark currently includes both the name “Zcash” as well as the Zcash logo and is currently registered or pending registration in the United States, European Union and approximately 10 other jurisdictions. Additionally, the word “ZEC” is now protected in some locations. It is our intent to fully publish trademark information in the first quarter of 2019.<br /></p>
