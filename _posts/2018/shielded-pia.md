<p><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a> has added support for shielded addresses! Private Internet Access protects your privacy by encrypting your connection and providing an alternate IP address to browse the web.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/z_shielded-e1518691774860.png" alt="" width="355" height="250" /><img src="https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/privateinternetaccess_01-e1518691828635.png" alt="" width="400" height="250" /></p>
<p>You can now use your favorite privacy-preserving cryptocurrency to purchase a privacy-enhancing service.</p>
<h3>Purchasing process</h3>
<p>To purchase their services via a Zcash shielded transaction, ensure that your wallet supports shielded transactions. There is a community maintained list of them <a href="https://www.zcashcommunity.com/wallets/">here</a>. Once you have your wallet set up and funded, head over to <a href="http://www.privateinternetaccess.com">www.privateinternetaccess.com</a> and choose the plan you wish to purchase.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pia_process_01.png" width="736" height="430" /></p>
<p>As your payment method, choose to pay with ZEC by clicking the button that says “pay anonymously with our Zcash z-address” option.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pia_process_02.png" width="749" height="430" /></p>
<p>You’ll need to enter in an email as a part of the purchase. If you don’t feel comfortable with providing your real email, use a temporary email services like <a href="http://dispostable.com/">dispostable</a>, <a href="http://www.fakeinbox.com/">fakeinbox</a>, or <a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/">guerillamail</a>. Make sure you are able to access the inbox, since that’s where they send credentials.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pia_process_03.png" width="736" height="430" /></p>
<p>Then, follow the instructions on the popup dialogue to send the payment to Private Internet Access’ shielded address.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pia_process_04.png" width="734" height="430" /></p>
<p>You’ll need to wait for a couple minutes for your payment to be detected and confirmed.</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pia_process_05.png" width="734" height="430" /></p>
<p>Once your payment is confirmed, you should see this popup!</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pia_process_06.png" width="734" height="430" /></p>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve purchased a privacy-enhancing technology with a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency. Check your email for the activation code and follow the instructions in the email to set up your VPN service.</p>
<h3>More to come</h3>
<p>In addition to shielded address support, the Private Internet Access team has expressed intent to support VPN service activation without an email requirement using the <a href="/blog/encrypted-memo-field/">Zcash encrypted memo field</a> as a way to further enhance customer privacy.  Learn more about Zcash support at Private Internet Access <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2018/02/private-internet-access-now-accepts-anonymous-zcash-shielded-payments/">here</a>.
