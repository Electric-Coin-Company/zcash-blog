<p><a href="https://www.bitgo.com">BitGo</a>, a market leader in institutional-grade cryptocurrency security, today announced support for Zcash. BitGo provides the highest level of security, compliance and custodial services. It is the world's largest processor of on-chain bitcoin transactions — processing 15% of all global bitcoin transactions and $15 billion per month across all cryptocurrencies. The company has a customer base that spans more than 50 countries and includes the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p><em>"We are working hard to offer our institutional clients the most complete portfolio of digital currencies," said Ben Chan, CTO, BitGo. "Zcash is a compelling digital currency that many hedge funds, exchanges and customers have been asking for because of its emphasis on privacy. We are glad to deliver a secure multi-signature implementation to store Zcash today."</em></p>
<p>BitGo represents a growing number of industry leaders that have recently announced support for Zcash. Already this year, <a href="/blog/hello-circle/">Circle</a> and <a href="/blog/gemini-announces-support-for-zcash/">Gemini</a> announced support for Zcash after <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1805141.htm">receiving approval from the NYDFS</a>. <a href="/blog/coinbase-exploring-zcash/">Coinbase recently announced</a> it is exploring adding Zcash for its 20+ million customers. We at the Zcash Company are excited that leaders like BitGo are adopting Zcash and that people are awakening to the benefits of financial privacy. We believe the <a href="/blog/whats-new-in-sapling/">upcoming Zcash Sapling upgrade</a> will fuel greater adoption of Zcash’s privacy features.</p>
