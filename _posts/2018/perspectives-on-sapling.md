<p>Last week we introduced a video series called <a href="/blog/zcash-perspectives/">Perspectives</a>. These short interviews were conducted at <a href="https://z.cash.foundation//blog/zcon0-recap/">Zcon0</a> on various topics relevant to the Zcash community.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Zcash Company <a href="/blog/new-release-2-0-0/">released the first Sapling-compatible Zcash node software</a> and announced that Sapling activation is set at a block height of 419200, which is expected to occur on Zcash’s second birthday, Oct. 28, 2018.</p>
<p>Sapling is a major protocol upgrade. Due to recent cryptographic breakthroughs, shielded (or private) addresses and transactions will soon be supported by mobile and hardware wallets, exchanges and payment processors. This will greatly improve the adoption of privacy and bring us closer to our vision of empowering everyone with economic freedom and opportunity.</p>
<p>For this week’s Perspectives, we’re highlighting Sapling. Zcash engineers <a href="https://twitter.com/ebfull">Sean Bowe</a> and Ariel Gabizon provide an overview of some of the detail and expected benefits with this upgrade, including proof-construction improvements, new zk-SNARK parameters, and delegated proving.</p>

Take a look at thoughts from <a href="https://youtu.be/xyNbW5Mdhrw">Zcash CTO Nathan Wilcox</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/gcV9KlnW-dc">Ethereum Founder and Chief Scientist Vitalik Buterin</a>.</p>
