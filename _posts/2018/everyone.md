<p>The Zcash brand is a sacred trust. <br />Between us, you, them, we.</p>
<p>It represents years of innovative thinking by brilliant scientists, cryptographers and engineers. <br />But Zcash is not science for the sake of science. <br />Zcash is not engineering for the sake of engineering.</p>
<p>The mission is broader.</p>
<p><b>Zcash was built as a means to empower everyone with economic freedom and opportunity.</b> <br /></p>
<p>To date, we have done a good job of informing and engaging fellow scientists and engineers with details on zk-SNARKs and elliptic curves. </p>
<p>Beginning late October, <a href="/blog/whats-new-in-sapling/">Sapling</a> will bring the power of shielded transactions to more people. Our brand and messaging should include them.</p>
<p>We hope that the refreshed brand and website reflect our clear and profound mission, <br /> inviting everyone to join us as we struggle together in this grand experiment â€” to shake financial foundations <br />and build a future that honors all people, for all time.</p>
