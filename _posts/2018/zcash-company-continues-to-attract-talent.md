<p>During these past few months, we have also had to bid farewell to two very talented team members, Hugh Kahn and Jay Graber. Hugh founded the Denver office and established the engineering team based there. He worked to create a more efficient engineering process at Zcash Company by implementing an agile process. Jay leaves us after having made a variety of significant contributions over time, from core engineering to user support and maintaining the Zcash website. She led the XCAT Project/Project Alchemy, wrote the Zcash testnet faucet app and the specifications and implementation for Overwinter’s transaction expiry.</p>
