<strong>Edit 2018-06-06:</strong> The community spotlight has now ended. There were only a few responses, with no resulting bug reports or criticisms. Thank you for participating.

Today we are kicking off a new feature on this blog, and weâ€™re calling it Community Spotlight. Each installment will feature a new Zcash application to showcase important work, and it gives you a chance to provide direct feedback to the developers.

Our first Community Spotlight features <a href="https://guarda.co/">Guarda</a>, who recently released a Zcash mobile wallet for Android. Guarda is a European company that builds an ecosystem of products for blockchain technologies. They build light wallets like the one featured here, but are also working on exchanges, prepaid cards, and hardware wallets.

Guarda <a href="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/grant-awards/">received a grant from the Zcash Foundation</a> late last year to make their Zcash light wallet. It currently supports unshielded addresses only, but the company plans to support shielded addresses after the Zcash Sapling upgrade.
