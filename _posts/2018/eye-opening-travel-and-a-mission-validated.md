<p>We see momentum everywhere. We see our beliefs — that everyone has a right to privacy, that the pursuit of economic freedom is virtuous, that the future of money is an attack- and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency — being shared in communities all over the world by more and more people.</p>
<p>And we are inspired by the ideas and ideals — and the challenges — this movement is bringing forth.</p>
<p>Zooko witnessed this groundswell on trips to India and Singapore earlier this month, where he met with developers, privacy advocates, students, journalists and policy makers.</p>

<p>In Bangalore, he was introduced to reporters from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.thehindu.com/" target="_blank">The Hindu</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/">The Economic Times</a> and met the IT Minister of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Karnataka">Karnataka</a> to provide inputs on the state’s blockchain roadmap. He met the founders of several Indian crypto exchanges (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.coinome.com/" target="_blank">Coinome</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.unocoin.com/" target="_blank">Unocoin</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://coinswitch.co/" target="_blank">CoinSwitch</a>), briefed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/india/" target="_blank">Sequoia</a> portfolio companies, and participated in a fireside panel hosted by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.accel.com/" target="_blank">Accel</a> that included more than 50 leading investors, tech operators and senior professionals in the Bangalore ecosystem. In Chennai, he attended a dinner with 30 key blockchain and technology experts and met with Dr. Pandu Rangan, the Head of Cryptography at IIT-Madras to discuss the latest developments with Zcash.</p>
<p>In Singapore, Zooko presented at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.decentralize.sg/" target="_blank">De/Centralize</a>, a blockchain conference “examining the thematic interplay of decentralization and centralization in technology, economics and law,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/zibin/status/983272126667833344" target="_blank">forged a few new relationships with companies like Pundix</a>, met with a number of top officials of the Singapore government, and he helped lead deep-dive blockchain training at the <a href="http://www.suss.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Singapore University of Social Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>The point of this brief post isn’t to provide a moment-by-moment itinerary of Zooko’s travels. But we point out some highlights because we were reminded that this movement we’re a part of is no small thing. We are encouraged and humbled, and our beliefs in freedom and economic opportunity are bolstered.</p>
