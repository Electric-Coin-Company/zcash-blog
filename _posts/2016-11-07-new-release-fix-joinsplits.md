<p>Today we're announcing the release of Zcash 1.0.2 which fixes a bug that prevented creating transactions to multiple shielded recipient addresses. This is an implementation bug in the <tt class="docutils literal">zcashd</tt> wallet which does not impact the consensus protocol.</p>
<p>The list of changes included in this release:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple"><li>We fixed a bug to ensure that JoinSplit transactions to multiple z-addresses will succeed. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1790">#1790</a>)</li>
<li>We changed z_sendmany to check if the size of a transaction for a given number of outputs will be valid. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1808">#1808</a>)</li>
<li>We fixed a bug that could crash the miner when it was interrupted. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1778">#1778</a>)</li>
<li>Community contributors helped improve our documentation. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1765">#1765</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1763">#1763</a>)</li>
</ol><p>We're encouraging all users and miners to update to this new version. See our <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash/download.html">download</a> page and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/1.0-User-Guide">1.0 User Guide</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>JoinSplits encapsulate zero-knowledge value transfer and have two private inputs and two private outputs. Multiple JoinSplits may be <cite>chained</cite> into a single transaction in order to spend more than two private inputs and/or send to more than two private outputs. The order of inputs and outputs can be a subtle information leak to private recipients (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/778">#778</a>). A patch to fix this information leak (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1561">#1561</a>) in our <a class="reference external" href="/new-release-candidate-less-than-one-week/">1.0.0-rc2</a> release randomizes the input and output orderings, but in doing so failed to permute the necessary commitment witnesses in the same manner as the private inputs. In this release weâ€™ve temporarily disabled input/output order randomization (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/1790">#1790</a>).</p>
