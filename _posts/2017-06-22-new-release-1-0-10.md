<strong>UPDATE:</strong> We are aware of an issue that causes nodes running v1.0.10 to be unable to connect to other nodes, and vice versa. Users are advised to upgrade to v1.0.10-1, which fixes the issue.

Today we're announcing the release of Zcash 1.0.10, which includes privacy and performance improvements, as well as bug fixes.

Summary of the changes included in this release:
<ol class="arabic simple">
 	<li>We improved the privacy of transactions created by our wallet that pay from shielded addresses to transparent addresses. The new version conceals more information about shielded note values in chained JoinSplit transactions. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2440">#2440</a>)</li>
 	<li>We improved reindexing and block download performance by switching to <tt class="docutils literal">libsecp256k1</tt> for transparent signature validation. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2335">#2335</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://speed.z.cash/comparison/?exe=1%2B305%2C1%2B320&amp;ben=15%2C14%2C11&amp;env=1&amp;hor=true&amp;bas=1%2B305&amp;chart=normal+bars">stats</a>)</li>
 	<li>We added a config parameter to reject transactions from the mempool by number of transparent inputs. This is a short-term workaround to handle periods of high network load, and will be replaced in the future by a more comprehensive mechanism. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2342">#2342</a>)</li>
 	<li>We merged several build system portability fixes. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2412">#2412</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2420">#2420</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2436">#2436</a>)</li>
