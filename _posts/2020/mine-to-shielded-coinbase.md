<p>As part of the <a href="https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/blog/introducing-heartwood/">Heartwood network upgrade</a>, Zcash miners and mining pools will have the option to mine directly to a shielded coinbase. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0213" target="_blank">ZIP 213</a> defines modifications to the Zcash consensus rules that enable this feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shielded coinbase allows Zcash users to have completely shielded ZEC from its creation. In addition to increased privacy, a considerable benefit to shielded coinbase is that miners have the option of getting their mining rewards issued immediately into a z-address. For transparent coinbase transactions, there is a standard maturity delay of 100 blocks before miners can transfer or spend the mined funds. Shielded coinbase transactions can be spent after a standard confirmation delay, just like any other shielded note, instead of waiting 100 blocks.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, mining pools receive coinbase rewards in a transparent address. Mining pools are required to move coinbases to a shielded address before paying out to miners. Some mining pools like FlyPool, give miners the option to receive payouts in a shielded address. With ZIP 213, the Zcash mining community will have more options. They can continue to mine to a transparent coinbase if they so choose or they can get their mining rewards faster by mining directly to a shielded coinbase.</p>

<p>Shielded coinbase has been on the Zcash roadmap since the projectâ€™s inception almost four years ago. The <a href="https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/blog/reducing-shielded-proving-time-in-sapling/">massive performance optimizations from Zcash Sapling</a> make shielded coinbase possible.</p>
