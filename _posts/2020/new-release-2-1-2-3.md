<p>Electric Coin Co. has released <span style="font-weight: 400;">zcashd 2.1.2-3, a hotfix that addresses issues identified in the Heartwood activation on testnet.</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This release fixes a crash on testnet that v2.1.2 nodes are likely to experience on startup. This release also allows nodes that did not follow the testnet activation of Heartwood to properly roll back and follow the Heartwood activation on testnet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we have ensured that this releaseâ€™s end-of-service halt is in the middle of July, just prior to our anticipated activation of Heartwood on mainnet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend that anyone testing their integration with Heartwood should upgrade to this release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
