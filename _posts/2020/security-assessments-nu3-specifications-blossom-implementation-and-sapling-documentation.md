<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two separate security assessments have been completed on ZIPs that specify&nbsp;changes in the upcoming Zcash network upgrade (now named "Heartwood").</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ZIP 213: "Shielded Coinbase" and ZIP 221: "FlyClient Zcash SPV" were assessed for security by firms NCC Group and Trail of Bits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, Trail of Bits produced some documentation helping to explain Sapling to newcomers, and NCC Group assessed the code implementation of the Blossom changes as part of their respective engagements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each team worked closely with the Electric Coin Co. engineering team, and both produced high-quality outputs that help provide vital security assurance on the Zcash network.</p>
