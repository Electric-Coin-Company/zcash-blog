<p>Zcash turns four years old in October, and there’s never been a better time to be part of the developer community. In this blog post, we outline new resources and showcase some existing initiatives that support people who want to build on Zcash.</p>

<h3>Developer resources</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zcash is an open-source project, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is committed to making Zcash a friendly and accessible community for developers of all skill levels and backgrounds. As we look ahead to October 2020, and a new <a href="https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/blog/dev-fund-poll-shows-consensus/">Major Grants fund</a> for independent developers, ECC invites developers to get familiarized with the Zcash ecosystem.</p>

<p>We understand that sometimes the hardest part of joining a community is taking the first step. An easy way to get involved is simply to join the conversation. Visit the <a href="https://discord.gg/CgVk4ma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zcash Discord</a> channel or join the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-the-zcash-gardening-club-a-monthly-open-zcash-development-call/36357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zcash Gardening Club</a>, a monthly community dev call, to meet other people passionate about building on Zcash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also suggest starting with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Zcash documentation</a> page. There you’ll find basic information for setting up a node, Github workflows and network upgrades. We recently put together a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/lightclient_support.html" target="_blank">suite of resources</a> specifically for light-clients. Light-client support is particularly useful for mobile wallet teams. We hope to add more resources and documentation in the coming months. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discord.gg/CgVk4ma" target="_blank">Let us know</a> what you would like to see more of.</p>

<h3>Build with us</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This quarter, ECC is participating in Gitcoin’s <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/privacy/onboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protect Privacy Hackathon</a>. Developer teams are invited to compete for bounty prizes and build applications that leverage shielded Zcash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More details are coming soon, but submissions can build off of existing libraries or use shielded transactions in a completely new way. You might build shielded support for your favorite wallet or come up with a messaging application using shielded memo fields. You could build a shielded merch store to buy and sell Zcash swag, or maybe you’ve got an original approach to integrating shielded Zcash to MetaMask. You might even have a fun idea for a game. Whatever your concept, we encourage you to have fun, get creative and ask plenty of questions along the way.</p>
