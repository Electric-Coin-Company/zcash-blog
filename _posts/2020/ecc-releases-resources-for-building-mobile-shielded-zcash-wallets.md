<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year, Electric Coin Co. released <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/blog/the-zcash-reference-wallet-is-here/" target="_blank">reference code for an experimental Android SDK wallet</a>, the first working implementation of a mobile, shielded-Zcash wallet. Today we are releasing a suite of libraries to support the shielded-Zcash ecosystem. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are excited to announce: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>An <em>improved</em> Android SDK, now with mainnet support&nbsp;</li><li>A <em>new</em> iOS SDK that provides equivalent functionalities&nbsp;</li><li>A compatible lightwalletd server with increased speed and efficiency&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our goal is to provide the resources necessary to support developers in their efforts for shielded addresses on mobile wallets on Android and iOS platforms. While still in active development, these open-source wallets are ready for teams to use, experiment with, and explore.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The mission</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our goal is bring financial freedom to everyone, and key to this objective is increasing the access and adoption of shielded addresses. If you’re a developer, we encourage you to build shielded-compatible mobile wallets with the SDKs and lightwalletd server. </p>

We welcome and appreciate feedback in the form of PRs, comments, and new issue reports on any of the code repositories above.
