<p>Electric Coin Co. is pleased to announce the <a href="https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/zcash-developer-alliance">Zcash Developer Alliance</a> (ZDA), an invite-only working group to advance Zcash development and interoperability. Six additional organizations round out the initial ZDA cohort: <a href="https://agoric.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agoric</a>, <a href="https://boltlabs.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bolt Labs</a>, <a href="https://consensys.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ConsenSys</a>, <a href="https://www.iqlusion.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iqlusion</a>, <a href="https://kyber.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyber</a> and <a href="https://thesis.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thesis</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ZDA facilitates multiple concurrent collaborations under a common mission, rather than establishing a single monolithic roadmap. For the inaugural year, the ZDA will focus on interoperability by building cross-chain bridges connecting Zcash to protocols like Ethereum and Cosmos.</p>

<p>The Zcash Developer Alliance held a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zda-meeting-summary-4-23/36482">kickoff meeting</a> April 23. To promote transparency and avoid inertia, ECC will post a short summary after each quarterly ZDA meeting. You'll be able to find those summaries on the community forum.</p>

<p><p>“The ECC mission is to empower everyone in the world with economic freedom” said Zooko Wilcox, ECC CEO. “It is humbling and inspiring that such a strong group of builders is leaning in to push that mission forward and help guide the future of Zcash.”</p>
