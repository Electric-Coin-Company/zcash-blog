<p>This is a test post to see if I can get anything to sync from https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that we've confirmed that action, I'm going to add a paragraph to the zcash-blog repo locally, push to Github and see if it updates on https://dev-electriccoinco-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/</p>

<p>Also adding a couple exclamation marks to the title.</p>
