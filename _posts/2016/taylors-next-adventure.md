<p>I'm both excited and saddened to announce that I'm leaving the Zcash team to pursue a Master's degree in Quantum Information at the University of Waterloo.</p>
<p>I'm excited because physics and computer science are my two favorite interests, and quantum information lies neatly at the intersection of the two. Influences like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl5dlbCh8lY">Carl Sagan</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjHJ7FmV0M4">Richard Feynman</a> taught me that learning our place in<br />
the universe, and learning how our world works, is a humbling experience that transforms us into better people. The physical worldview is one I hold dear, so I can't wait to begin learning and popularizing the mathematics of quantum information. If you're interested in following my studies, I'll be blogging at <a class="reference external" href="https://bqp.io/">BQP.io</a>.</p>
<p>I'm saddened to be leaving an amazing <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash/team.html">team</a> and an amazing place to work. One of the best things about working for Zcash is that we all have domains of expertise and we all learn from each other. I'm leaving as a more productive programmer, better communicator, more patient mathematician, and a more careful security engineer than I was when I joined Zcash over a year ago. I owe thanks to every member of the Zcash team.</p>
<p>The great team makes me confident Zcash will be a success, and I'm super excited for the production blockchain to launch this Fall!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for our next blog post about the new hires.</p>
