<p class="last">The schedule in this post is outdated. Please see our newer post <a class="reference external" href="/blog/zcash-launch-and-roadmap/">Zcash Launch and Roadmap</a> for the up-to-date schedule for the Zcash launch and the Sprout release series.</p>

</div>
<p>In September 2016 the first <a class="reference external" href="/blog/helloworld/">open, permissionless financial system</a> with zero-knowledge security will launch: the Zcash blockchain.</p>
<p>Starting with version 1.0 of Zcash, we're launching the <cite>Sprout</cite> series, emphasizing that Zcash will begin life as a young, tender thing, but will be a living organism with great potential to grow. It will be a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency with zero-knowledge privacy, a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/why-equihash/">new Proof-of-Work algorithm</a>, and an API.</p>
<p>The Zcash core design is now in our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf">Zcash Protocol specification</a>. Our roadmap for the 1.0 launch has firmed up. It's embodied in our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/milestones/">github milestones</a>.</p>
<p><cite>Sprout</cite> is only the beginning and there are exciting innovations to come.</p>
