<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash">Zcash Company</a> sponsored this challenge to help strengthen and decentralize the Zcash community, as well as contribute to the advancement of computer science. <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/">Least Authority</a>, as a supporter of the Zcash Company, operated this challenge.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/">Zcash Open Source Miner Challenge</a> has made mining for ZEC accessible to more people and facilitated collaboration within the Zcash community. While the <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/submissions">code available</a> is off to a good start, we encourage everyone to continue improving and building upon each other's work. The challenge website will transition to repository of these open source minersâ€¦ And we may even do another challenge in the future!</p>
