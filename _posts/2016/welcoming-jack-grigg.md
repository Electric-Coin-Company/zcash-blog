<p>Hello, I'm Nathan Wilcox and I do project management and engineering on Zcash. I'm delighted to announce the most recent hire onto <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash/team.html#engineers">our engineering team</a>: Jack Grigg.</p>
<p>When Zooko first excitedly exclaimed he had been in contact with Jack about working with us, I'll admit the name wasn't familiar to me. It turns out, that's because I was only familiar with his superhero alter-ego: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/str4d">str4d</a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center"><img class="zecc-blog-standard-image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jack.jpg" alt="Jack Grigg aka str4d"" alt="Jack Grigg aka str4d" /></p>
<p class="caption">Jack Grigg aka str4d</p>
</div>
<p>By day, Jack is an applied physics PhD student, and by night, a privacy-focused crypto hacker. At Real World Crypto '16, str4d made the bold step of unmasking this pseudonym.</p>
<p>I first became aware of str4d as a contributor on the integration of privacy-preserving network protocols such as <a class="reference external" href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a> into <a class="reference external" href="http://foolscap.lothar.com/trac">foolscap</a>, a capabilities-secure remote procedure call <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> library and protocol. Under this pseudonym, Jack actively contributes to or leads development on <a class="reference external" href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/i2p/i2p.android.base">I2P Android</a>, and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/str4d/txi2p">txi2p</a> endpoint for <a class="reference external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>, as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/str4d/ed25519-java">ed25519-java</a>.</p>
<p>All of this has been in addition to his by-day work as a physics student where he's working on a thesis about sheep's wool. A true polyglot, Jack's been settling in quite naturally on our team. His first task is to create a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/str4d/zcash-pow">mining prototype</a> for Zcash <a id="id1" class="footnote-reference" href="#id2">[*]</a>. Please join us in welcoming Jack Grigg aka str4d out of the crypto-closet and into wondrous land of cryptocurrency.</p>

<td>We've seen a lot of curiosity about Zcash mining. While we haven't settled on specifics, this is certainly the codebase to watch in the coming month to see what we're prototyping.</td>
