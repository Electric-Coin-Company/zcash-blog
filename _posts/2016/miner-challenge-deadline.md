<p>The Zcash Open Source Miner Challenge deadline is just two days away! All submissions that want to be considered for the Challenge prizes need to be entered and finalized by 27 October at 23:59 UTC.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ll publish all viable submissions by the launch of Zcash on 28 October and the winners will be announced on 2 December. Submissions, along with links to the code hosted on GitHub, will be on the <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/submissions">Challenge website</a>. Anyone with a miner not participating in the Challenge, but still interested in having it listed should send information to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:challenge@zcashminers.org">challenge@zcashminers.org</a>.</p>
<p>We encourage you to take a look at the current submissions and build upon them (and provide attribution). More miners enable a wider community to mine for Zcash coins and take collective ownership of the network as a public good. The more individuals who run a miner (whether GPU or CPU), the stronger the Zcash network.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in the Challenge, please look at <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/timeline">the timeline</a>, read <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/rules">the rules</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/judging">the judging criteria</a>, before <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/apply">applying</a>. The Zcash Company is sponsoring a prize fund of $30,000 for the winner(s) of the challenge. Note that the winning CPU entry will receive a $10,000 prize and the winning GPU entry will receive a $10,000 prize and the other $10,000 of prizes will be distributed to the Runners Up.</p>
<p>You can also participate in the discussions on the <a class="reference external" href="https://inviteme.z.cash/">Zcash Community Slack</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.z.cash/">the Zcash forum</a>.</p>
