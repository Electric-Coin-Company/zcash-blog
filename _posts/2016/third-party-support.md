<p><strong>Update: 2017-09-25</strong> - This article is left as-is for posterity. The list of supporting services and vendors for Zcash is constantly evolving. See ZcashCommunity.com's lists of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zcashcommunity.com/markets/">markets</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zcashcommunity.com/wallets/">wallets</a> for up-to-date community-curated lists.</p>
<p>The Zcash core team is thrilled to have many supporters at launch. It is a sign of a robust and diverse ecosystem already beginning to grow.</p>
<p>Zcash is an experimental new technology and external support is highly valuable at this nascent stage. As a science-based team, we are focusing our energies on building and engineering the protocol, and we do not have current plans to build a GUI wallet. There are multiple developers in our community who have stepped up to do so.</p>
<p>What follows is a list of some of the wallets and exchange that we currently know about.</p>
<p>A word of caution: there have already been multiple scams and fraudulent projects, so we suggest researching any third-party application well before using.</p>
<p>This post is intended for Zcash users who want to involve themselves in the early phase of the ecosystem but do not know how to install and run the Zcash software (Linux-only, command-line tool). This post is not an endorsement of any wallet or exchange. Rather it’s a listing of current providers – that we know about – who already support Zcash.</p>
<p>We hope that as this community grows, other individuals will take on the responsibility of maintaining a repository or lists of Zcash providers. For example, Zcash contributor <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.z.cash/users/vaklinov/activity">@vaklinov</a> has begun hosting a list of wallets here: <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashblog.wordpress.com/zcash-gui-wallets/">https://zcashblog.wordpress.com/zcash-gui-wallets/</a>.</p>
<p>We have not yet written down our thoughts about the privacy consequences of using Zcash via third-party service providers. For the time being, you could probably just simplify by assuming that when you use a third-party service provider, the metadata about your transactions will be visible to others — at least to that provider and probably also to others who can see the transactions associated with your address, in the blockchain.</p>
<p>However, if the people you are transacting with use Zcash’s shielded addresses, then that may give you a degree of privacy even if you are not yet using shielded addresses yourself. We will write more to explain the way this works in the future.</p>
