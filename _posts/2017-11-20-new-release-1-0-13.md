<strong>Edit 2018-05-31:</strong> Auto-senescence terminology changed to "end-of-support halt".

Today we're announcing the release of Zcash 1.0.13, introducing new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. Our new low-memory prover reduces memory usage by 43% when generating a shielded transaction, from 3 GB to 1.7 GB. An experimental feature, payment disclosure, can help services better manage their shielded payments. We also now fully support the <tt class="docutils literal">z_shieldcoinbase</tt> RPC call to help miners sweep up and shield their coinbase rewards.

Summary of the changes included in this release:
<ol class="arabic simple">
 	<li>End-of-support halt (previously called "auto-senescence") cycle has been reduced from 18 to 16 weeks. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2733">#2733</a>)</li>
