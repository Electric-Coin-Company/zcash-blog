<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://z.cash">Zcash Company</a> sponsored this challenge to help strengthen and decentralize the Zcash community, as well as contribute to the advancement of computer science. <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/">Least Authority</a>, as a supporter of the Zcash Company, operated this challenge.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/">Zcash Open Source Miner Challenge</a> has made mining for ZEC accessible to more people and facilitated collaboration within the Zcash community. While the <a class="reference external" href="https://zcashminers.org/submissions">code available</a> is off to a good start, we encourage everyone to continue improving and building upon each other's work. The challenge website will transition to repository of these open source miners… And we may even do another challenge in the future!</p>
