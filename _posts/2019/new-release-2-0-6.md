<h1>Notable Changes in this Release</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of this release, Debian Stretch (v9) is fully supported for <code>zcashd</code>. While previous versions of <code>zcashd</code> worked with Stretch, this release marks full infrastructure support for the current version of Debian. If you are still running Debian Jessie (v8) for your <code>zcashd</code> environment, we highly recommend upgrading due to the increasing lack of support and security updates for Jessie. Please see our <a href="https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/install_debian_bin_packages.html#upgrading-debian-8-jessie-to-debian-9-stretch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> on how to proceed.Â </p>
