<p>Zcash is now featured on Coinbase Earn, a platform that pays people in cryptocurrency to watch videos and complete tasks. Check out the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/earn/zcash?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=zcash&amp;utm_campaign=zec_launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Coinbase Earn ZEC Page</a> here.<br /></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Zcash Company has allocated 15,518 ZEC for this initiative aimed at educating millions of people globally about Zcash — a privacy-protecting, digital currency built on strong science. &nbsp;Half of the ZEC will be distributed in this first campaign, while the other half is reserved for future Earn Zcash tasks. <em>100% of these tokens will be distributed to Coinbase Earn users. </em><br /></p>

<h3>Learn more about Zcash</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Earn ZEC campaign consists of a series of three engaging and short educational videos that are available for everybody to watch. At the start, selected Coinbase users will be invited via email to earn ZEC for watching these videos and demonstrating their knowledge of Zcash.<br /></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have not received an invite to earn, please join the waitlist on the Earn ZEC Page to be notified once earning opportunities are available to you. <br /></p>

<p>The first video provides an introduction to the origin of Zcash and the underlying privacy design. The second video explores how Zcash combines the privacy of cash with the global reach of a cryptocurrency. The final video describes everyday applications for transparent and shielded addresses, making a case for Zcash as a decentralized global currency.</p>
