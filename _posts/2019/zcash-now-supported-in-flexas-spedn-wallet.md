<h2>Spending your Zcash has never been easier</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Flexa <a href="https://medium.com/flexa/zcash-is-live-on-flexa-9398c9c49a60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">just announced</a> support for Zcash on the SPEDN wallet. <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/gemini-and-flexa-team-up-to-deliver-cryptocurrency-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Flexa and its partnership with Gemini</a> was announced earlier this year during New York Blockchain Week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Flexa enables tap-and-pay Zcash spending at thousands of major retailers. Using only your smartphone and Flexa’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spedn-by-flexa/id1456135087?ls=1">SPEDN wallet</a>, you can pay with Zcash for everyday purchases <em>—</em> like a cup of coffee on the way to work or take-out dinner on the way back home. Zcash is immediately available to all SPEDN wallet users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Zcash is arguably the best digital currency for protecting privacy and promoting global economic freedom across the Flexa network,” said Tyler Spalding, Flexa co-founder &amp; CEO. “We’re proud to support ECC and the Crypto Community Project and help bring meaningful progress towards financial inclusion."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The announcement was made as a part of joint work by the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and Flexa on a pilot program called the <a href="http://cryptocommunityproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Crypto Community Project</a>. The program brings together young people in the South Bronx, Aug. 1-2, with a goal of increasing crypto-awareness and adoption in underserved communities. Participant students will be able to access the SPEDN wallet and begin using Zcash at any of the 39,000 Flexa-network-supported retail locations.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to ECC and Flexa, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gemini.com/" target="_blank">Gemini</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keys.casa/" target="_blank">Casa</a> and other crypto-focused companies are lending their support to the project. More information on the Crypto Community Project will be released at a later date.<br><br></p>

<h3>How Can I Use the Wallet to Spend Zcash?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spending your Zcash is as simple as: load, tap and pay! Just download <a href="https://spedn.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the SPEDN app</a> from the iOS App Store (the Android app is still in <a href="https://flexahq.typeform.com/to/QjQL6X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">beta</a>), tap Zcash to load it onto the wallet, and pay by having the cashier scan the flexcode that appears on your screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, in seconds, your Zcash balance is converted into USD, covering all or part of your purchase, and your transaction is complete.<br><br></p>
