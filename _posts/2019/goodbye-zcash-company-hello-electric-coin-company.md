<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Zcash Company is now the Electric Coin Company. We’re changing the name for clarity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our legal name has always been the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, LLC, and we’ve been calling ourselves the ‘Zcash Company.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, the company isn’t "Zcash." Zcash is the cryptocurrency we build and support, with the help of others in the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, we aren’t the <a href="https://www.zfnd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Zcash Foundation</a>. The Foundation is a separate and independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. It has its own mission, team and board of directors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So here we are: Electric Coin Company. It’ll take us a little while to get the new branding right, launch a new domain and change out the sign at the office, but the name change is public, so we wanted to make sure we were on record confirming it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only the name has changed. We are the same team, with the same mission: to empower everyone with economic freedom and opportunity. We developed and help steward Zcash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
