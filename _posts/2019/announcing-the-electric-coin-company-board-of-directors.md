<p>The Electric Coin Company is pleased to announce we have recently formed a board of directors and seated three members: Alan Fairless, Andrew McLaughlin and Zooko Wilcox.<br /></p>

<p>The board provides oversight and governance in support of the company’s mission to empower everyone with economic freedom and opportunity.

Since its launch in 2016, Zcash has quickly grown to be one of the most valued and admired cryptocurrencies in the world.<br /><br /></p>
