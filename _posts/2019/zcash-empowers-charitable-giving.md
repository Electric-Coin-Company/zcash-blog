<p>The Electric Coin Company’s mission is to empower everyone with economic freedom and opportunity. We believe that everyone has a right to privacy — in fact, we deem it to be a <em>fundamental </em>human right — and this belief extends to charitable giving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Privacy is built into the core of Zcash, allowing people to send and receive Zcash without disclosing the sender, receiver or the amount transacted. This is a leap forward for charitable giving, allowing privacy preferences to extend beyond the wishes of the donor to include the recipient’s preferences, as well. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zcash technology <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-is-now-the-worlds-first-licensed-zcash-exchange-dfa7da992816" target="_blank">has been characterized by regulated exchanges</a> as “a truly innovative privacy coin that offers confidentiality for peer-to-peer transactions similar to those afforded to fiat currency transfers (e.g. ACH, FedWire, SWIFT).” <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Private donations are powerful</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Privacy is a critical component of charitable giving, for both the donor and recipient. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charities are firmly focused on the organization’s mission and the good work that brings it to fruition. However, donations that come from sources with real or implied bias can distract from the mission. In these instances, private donations are encouraged but can sometimes pose a logistical challenge when using traditional fiat transfers (e.g. check or wire).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conversely, donors oftentimes wish to be the quiet heroes who support the mission without attribution. However, despite the vast array of traditional fiat transfer options, financial privacy has remained elusive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zcash provides a solution whereby both parties may choose to transact without revealing information about the sender, receiver and the amount. However, both parties are able to verify that the transaction was successful through the blockchain ledger. This empowers charitable causes to stay focused on their mission and private donors to remain the quiet heroes who support causes in which they believe. <br></p>

Vaughn cites a personal experience which served as his inspiration for building this page. “My first purchase using Zcash was a laptop sticker from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://openbazaar.com/store/QmYs2Hc2b2dMWPw1qbrYWS5zCRRjWzgUu3XAPWP239SNGp" target="_blank">Boston Zcash User Group</a>.
