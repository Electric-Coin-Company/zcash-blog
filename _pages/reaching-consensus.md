<h2>Everyone knew it was coming.</h2>

<p>In November 2020, funding for Zcash development would expire with no built-in replacement. Since 2016, a sometimes-controversial “Founders Reward” has been routing 20 percent of block rewards to Electric Coin Co. (ECC), the Zcash Foundation, and founders and investors who helped create the Zcash digital currency.</p>

<p>This looming sunset was not unexpected, but with an end to funding in sight, the future of Zcash was uncertain. If ECC and the Zcash Foundation were no longer subsidized, would community volunteers pick up the development torch? Would anyone be incented to advocate for Zcash at exchanges, wallets and regulating bodies? Would the digital currency with the strongest privacy protections survive at a time when breaches of freedom, security, dignity and consent were becoming more and more common?</p>

<p>In other industries and sectors, this may have been a non-problem. Any other parent organization would simply propose a new model to be adopted by its board, and that would be that. But this, of course, isn’t a typical industry and Zcash doesn’t have a typical governance model.</p>

<p>In this case, a solution was conceived in the only place it could be: the Zcash community.</p>

<p>On Jan. 3, 2019, community forum member mineZcash raised their hand and set off a year-plus-long discussion that would result in a multi-channel, community-sentiment-gathering apparatus; a unique trademark agreement to go along with increased decentralization within an all-new governance model; and consensus from the community on a plan to continue funding of Zcash development.</p>
