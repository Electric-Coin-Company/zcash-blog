<p>Since its inception in 2016, Electric Coin Company has had the good fortune to work with a wide variety of ecosystem projects, products and services across the cryptocurrency space. We value those relationships and respect the trust we have earned.</p>

<h2 id="mce_1">Zcash Listing Fee and Co-Marketing Policy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To maintain the integrity of each and every partnership, Electric Coin Company has a strict “no listing fee” policy, which means we will not pay to have ZEC listed on an exchange, nor will we provide liquidity at the onset. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We welcome co-marketing opportunities on a case-by-case basis — which may include the creation or sharing of announcements across social media channels, blog posts, AMAs or other similar engagement and outreach strategies — for mutual benefit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We invite inquiries about new collaboration opportunities; please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:collaborate@electriccoin.co">collaborate@electriccoin.co</a> to discuss the possibilities. </p>
