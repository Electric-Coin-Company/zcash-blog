<p>After a series of proposals, forum conversations and a number of polls, the solution to the problem of ongoing Zcash development support was ratified and approved — not by the Zcash Foundation or ECC — by the community. And the consensus was this: In November 2020 (and for the next four years), 80 percent of Zcash issuance will continue to be distributed to miners, while 20 percent will be devoted to Zcash development funding. Importantly, 8 percent of the total block reward (or about 35 percent of the new dev fund) will go into a grant program that will exclusively fund independent third-party developers. ECC will receive 7 percent of the total rewards, and the remaining 5 percent of rewards will go to support the work of the Zcash Foundation.</p>

<p>This keeps ECC intact and focused on Zcash, and it ensures the continued support of the Zcash Foundation, as well. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The introduction of the grant program is massively important, as community leaders have pushed for more decentralization of the currency. And even though the breakdown may lead to a budget shortfall at ECC (depending on coin price), CEO Zooko Wilcox and others <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/final-text-of-zip-1014/36002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have said</a> that inviting other teams into the Zcash development ecosystem is paramount to the integrity and growth of the protocol.</p>

<h2>Community-driven process</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outcome — a continued funding model for Zcash development — is the critical result of this process, but in many ways, the process itself is as important a story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When mineZcash kicked off the public conversation in January 2019, it was an open invitation to Zcash users and the crypto community at large. As Zcash community forum users began to contribute their ideas and concerns over the following months, personnel from ECC and ZF began helping to organize the discussions, with the Zcash Foundation offering formal proposal guidelines in July of that year. From this point on, any community member could submit a proposal to be considered on the forum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And submit they did. All told, community members contributed more than 20 proposals. While there were some outliers, and this number was eventually narrowed to 13, the majority of proposals supported a continuation of the 80-20 miners’ rewards split in order to support ongoing development. The differences in proposals were most commonly found in how to distribute the 20 percent pool amongst development stakeholders.</p>

<p>By Q4, the community was giving feedback on proposals, participating in polling exercises, and preparing for a final vote. By January 2020, the current solution (as described above) was articulated in a final proposal. Having been vetted by all stakeholders, the proposal went to a vote in late January, and on January 28, the current proposal was approved by the Zcash community at large. In November 2020, the new funding model will be implemented.</p>

<h2>Furthering decentralized governance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the midst of this community-led dev fund process, leaders from ECC and ZF worked out a new trademark agreement that essentially sees a donation of the Zcash trademark from ECC to the Zcash Foundation. Under this novel — and unprecedented — agreement both organizations must approve all uses of the trademark. From the ECC announcement:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In essence, the contract transfers ownership of the trademark to the foundation — at no cost — and stipulates rights, obligations and limitations.</p><p>It’s a novel agreement, for which there appears to be no precedent, containing unique stipulations such as this: No party has independent authority to declare that a specific chain of Zcash can actually be called Zcash. There must be agreement from both parties, and neither party can unilaterally override the will of the community.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The move strengthens the Zcash brand, fortifies legal protections and enhances the power of the community’s voice.</p>
