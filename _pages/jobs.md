<h2>About Electric Coin Company</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We're on a mission to empower everyone with economic freedom and opportunity, and we need your help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe that everyone has a right to privacy, that the pursuit of economic freedom is virtuous, and that the future of money is an attack- and censorship-resistant digital currency. Electric Coin Company launched and supports the development of the Zcash cryptocurrency — a privacy-protecting, digital currency built on strong science. Since its launch in 2016, Zcash has quickly grown to be one of the most valued and admired cryptocurrencies in the world.</p>

<h3>Our Culture</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know that the people that work at Electric Coin Company are the most important part of our success, and we work hard to take care of our team. In addition to a generous health benefits package, that includes medical, dental, and vision, we also offer many non-typical benefits as well. We enjoy Fun Fridays, where we empower our employees to spend time on research and personal development; we offer opportunities to attend conferences that are company-sponsored. Additionally we have yearly meet ups for our international team to get together. We’re a unique mix of a start-up mentality but with the infrastructure of a larger company; it’s really the best of both worlds!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in integrity, humility, openness and collaboration. Our work springs out of a passion for inclusive financial systems and we have a deep respect for our co-workers and families. We strive to create an environment for psychological safety, empowerment, sense of purpose, and challenging work for our multifarious team. We strive to foster a highly collaborative, ego-less, open, highly diverse, friendly work environment. Decentralization is one of our core values, and this shows in our commitment to empowering all of our team members to make an impact at Electric Coin Company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today the company is distributed and most employees work remotely; we also have a physical office in Denver, CO. If you want to work remotely, great! We provide extensive support to our distributed employees. If you’d prefer to work in our Denver office, we’ll happily relocate you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently the company is mostly comprised of scientists, researchers and software developers who all specialize in software security, privacy and cryptography. We are now expanding our knowledge in other pertinent areas by adding new team members with more diverse experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Who We Are Looking For</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our team is the cornerstone of our company's strategy to build a permissionless inclusive global financial platform. The right applicant will cultivate our team and continue our tradition of releasing secure cutting edge cryptographic software.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in emergent team intelligence. We think that a high functioning team is greater than the sum of its parts. We seek people who are “multipliers.” People who create a positive and supportive environment for the people around them. People who demonstrate a high degree of conscientiousness with their team members and in their work. We highly value humility, openness, good judgment, integrity, collaboration, curiosity and independent thinking.</p>
