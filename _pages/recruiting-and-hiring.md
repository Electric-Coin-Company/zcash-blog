<p>Electric Coin Company is committed to attracting the best talent. As part of that commitment, we would like to provide the resources you need to feel comfortable throughout our recruiting and hiring process. Our hiring process is outlined below in order to be as transparent as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Recruiting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are passionate about diversity and inclusion at Electric Coin Company, and that starts with the recruiting process. We consciously do not include hard requirements for years of experience, degrees or titles in our job postings; we focus on whether or not you can help us succeed in our mission to give everyone on Earth an open, inclusive financial system.</p>

<h2>Interviewing / Hiring Process</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you submit your application, you will quickly be put in touch with a contact at Electric Coin Company who will shepherd you through the interview process. Please, please, please don’t hesitate to reach out to them to get status updates as the interview process progresses. The entire process below can take as little as three weeks if you want to move quickly. Electric Coin Company is a distributed company and as a result many or all of your interviews will be over a video call. If you do happen to reside near our Denver office, some of your interviews may be in-person at the Denver office. The hiring process has four steps: an initial screening, a behavioral interview, a technical interview (for technical positions only), team interviews (for non-technical positions) and a final interview with a Electric Coin Company executive.</p>

<h3>Initial Screening</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our recruiting team will reach out to you for an initial screening to get to know who you are, discuss your strengths and find out if you and Electric Coin Company are a good fit for each other. We view these discussions as an opportunity where we first get to know each other; each discussion typically takes no more than 30 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Behavioral Interview<br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Included in our hiring process is a structured team-oriented interview. This is a chance to tell some of your most impressive accomplishments  — and maybe even brag a little! Questions in this interview will reveal your abilities in communication, collaboration, and navigating stressful situations. This is also a great time for you to ask questions about our team and what it’s like to work at Electric Coin Company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>For Technical Roles: Technical Interview</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This portion of the interview is 90 minutes, with a 10-minute break built in. Electric Coin Company engineers will ask you a few short-answer questions to gauge your level of technical knowledge as it relates to the position we’re hiring for and then all three of you will dive into a pairing exercise. <strong>Whether or not you “solve” the problem is not important to us, instead we are trying to get a feel for how you approach new problems and how you communicate and work with other engineers.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>For Non-Technical Roles: Team Interviews</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point, you have a pretty good idea what the hiring process may entail, but what about the people you’ll be working with? In our team interviews, 2-3 Zcashers get a chance to speak with you about your interests, core values and how you work in a team environment. This is an excellent opportunity for you to find out more about the day-to-day environment at Electric Coin Company and gives us a chance to get to know the whole you better. Feel free to ask questions here and at any point in the interview process about Electric Coin Company culture, upcoming projects, or anything else you may be curious about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Final Interview</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your final interview will be with a Electric Coin Company executive team member. Don’t be scared! If you’ve made it this far you’ve done a stellar job impressing our team. This is an opportunity to get direct insight into the leadership at Electric Coin Company and ask any remaining questions to determine if you and Electric Coin Company are a good fit for one another.</p>
